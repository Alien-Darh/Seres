These crystals have unique properties that make them very effective in generating energy. The collision of several atoms of matter with others of antimatter in a Dilithium Crystal generates a plasma that serves as a power source for the curvature motors that allow spacecraft to travel faster than light. However, its energy must be recharged and wait a while before using it again to avoid overheating of the motors."

The atomic properties of quantizing an antimatter collision when passing through a Quartz Crystal generates a plasma that is possible to create a temporal distortion field in front of spacecraft, creating a long-range artificial hole make it unique in its class. However, its energy is depleted quickly and its recharge is very slow, but it is effective against surprise attacks."
