These crystals have unique properties that make them very effective in generating energy. The collision of several atoms of matter with others of antimatter in a Dilithium Crystal generates a plasma that serves as an energy source for curvature engines that allow spacecraft to travel faster than light. However, its energy must be recharged and wait a while before using it again to avoid overheating of the motors."
