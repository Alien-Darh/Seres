These crystals have unique properties that make them very effective in generating energy. The collision of several atoms of matter with others of antimatter in a Dilithium Crystal generates a plasma that serves as an energy source for curvature engines that allow spacecraft to travel faster than light. However, its energy must be recharged and wait a while before using it again to avoid overheating of the motors."

These crystals have unique properties that make them very effective in generating energy. The atomic properties of quantizing an antimatter collision when passing through a Quartz Crystal generates a plasma that can create a temporal distortion field against spacecraft, creating a long-range artificial hole that makes it unique in its class. However, its energy runs out quickly and its recharge is very slow, but it is effective against surprise attacks."
